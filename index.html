								<!-- <p><h3 style="color:red">The IndoSys 2020 committee has decided to cancel the event this year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This decision has been made keeping in mind the safety, and well-being of our members and all our attendees and serves as the reason for our decision to cancel this edition of the IndoSys 2020.</h3></p>-->
								<p>Computer systems research is critically important in this post-Moore era, where we are dealing with diverse Big Data platforms, scalability challenges of deep learning models, and heterogeneous accelerators, including quantum hardware, available on Cloud and edge platforms. The <b>Indian Symposium on Computer Systems (IndoSys)</b> is conceived as a forum to support and improve the Computer Systems Research ecosystem in India. The number of academic and research labs working on systems research in India are fewer than in other computer science areas. IndoSys will provide a platform to gather a critical mass of systems researchers to network and interact with each other, and get familiar with the latest research conducted by groups across India. It will also give opportunities for early career faculty and students, especially from aspirational colleges, to present and get feedback on their work-in-progress systems research, including on how to perform <a href="https://gernot-heiser.org/benchmarking-crimes.html">rigorous benchmarks</a>, and gain ongoing mentorship. Lastly, IndoSys 2025 will have a set of tutorials on latest systems research topics to help faculty and students become conversant with these emerging trends and potentially strengthen the coursework in their colleges. IndoSys has hopes to benefit several target audiences — students, faculty, researchers and industry working in systems research.</p><p>
								</p><p><b>IndoSys 2025</b> is being revived after a hiatus due to COVID, and will be hosted at the Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT), Bangalore on July 24-26, 2025. Past editions of IndoSys were hosted at <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/conf/indosys-2019/">IISc, Bangalore (2019)</a>, <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/conf/indosys-2018/">IIT, Hyderabad (2018)</a>, <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/conf/indosys-2017/">IIT, Bombay (2017)</a>, <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/conf/indosys-2016/">IIT, Madras (2016)</a>, <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/conf/indosys-2015/">IIIT, Hyderabad (2015)</a>, and <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/conf/indosys-2014/">CDAC, Bangalore (2014)</a>.

								<p>IndoSys invites two categories of papers: <b>Work in Progress (WIP) papers</b> by early career faculty from aspirational colleges and by students to solicit feedback to strengthen their work, and <b>Invited Papers</b> from established groups to <i>present their prior work</i> that has appeared in top systems conferences/journals. Accepted publications <i>will not appear</i> in any formal proceedings.</p>
								<p>Research topics of interest include all areas of computer systems, including Operating Systems and Virtualization, Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, Distributed Algorithms, High Performance Computing, Cloud and Edge Computing, Mobile Computing, Blockchain, Platforms for ML/DL, Internet of Things, Big Data Systems, Computer Architecture, Compilers, Quantum+Classical computing, etc. Submissions can be to one of the following tracks:</p>
								
								<h3>Invited Papers</h3>
								<p>We invite previously published research at top systems conferences/journals related to the above areas. Submissions will be evaluated for relevance and quality. Authors of accepted submissions will be invited to present their prior work to the audience, to spur discussions and collaborations and to inspire further high quality from India. Since IndoSys does not have any formal proceedings, there are not copyright or ethical concerns.</p>
								
								<h3>Work In Progress (WIP) Faculty Papers</h3>
								<p>We invite faculty from aspirational academic institutions in India to submit their <em>unpublished manuscript</em> (maximum <b>4</b> pages) on a research problem that they are currently working, related to systems research. The paper should include sections on (1) the problem description, (2) novelty of the problem and existing literature, (3) the technical solution proposed and its impact, (4) current progress and early results, (5) future work and mentorship required, and (6) References. The goal is to gain feedback from experts in the area who are present at IndoSys and also ongoing mentorship to help shepherd the work into a high quality research outcome that can be published. One of the authors of the submission must be a current faculty, preferably early in their career (within 5 years of experience), along with student authors who are expected to continue working on the paper. The faculty should attend and present their work at IndoSys, if accepted. Papers will be evaluated for their novelty of ideas, technical correctness, preliminary work that has been completed, quality of presentation, and potential for eventually leading to good research outcomes.</p>

								<!--<p>Topics include but are not limited to:</p>
								<ul>
								 <li>Design of Parallel and Distributed Algorithms</li>
								 <li>Middleware and Runtime Systems for HPC, Commodity clusters and Clouds</li>
								 <li>Load Balancing, Scheduling and Resource Management Techniques</li>
								 <li>High Performance Computing, Cloud computing, Edge computing and Internet of Things</li>
								 <li>Accelerators and Power-Efficient Architectures</li>
								 <li>Big Data platforms and Systems</li>
								 <li>Scientific Computing Applications</li>
								 <li>Data-driven Applications and Analytics</li>
								 <li>Graph Analytics, Processing and Management</li>
								<li>Systems design, measurement, and performance analysis for machine learning</li>
								</ul>

								<p>The position paper will be evaluated by a program committee for their technical strength, prior preparation and outcomes, and the potential for being mentored into a good quality research paper. Selected teams will be invited to attend the IndoSys symposium for presenting their work, and engaging with experts to advance their ideas. Submissions may be accepted for <em>oral presentation or as a poster</em>.</p>

								<p>Faculty whose position paper is accepted for oral presentation or as a poster presentation must register and attend IndoSys during 24-26 July 2025 in Bangalore. For the oral presentation, the team will have the chance to present their problem during a short 15 minute presentation, followed by a 10 minute discussion. Based on the potential of the research work presented, they may be assigned a mentor for further discussion and refinement of the topics. Teams selected for poster presentation will have a chance to display their poster and interact with the experts during the breaks. All selected papers should print and bring their own posters. Easels and pushpins will be provided.</p>

								<p>Faculty are strongly encouraged to bring up to two students or research scholars supervised by them to attend the symposium, and benefit from the discussions. However, students unaccompanied by faculty, are not permitted to attend in this track.</p>-->
								
								
								<h3>Work In Progress (WIP) Student Papers </h3>
								<p>Indosys 2025 will feature a separate track for students to submit a WIP paper. The submission format is the same as for WIP Faculty papers given above, with the key distinction being that <b>all authors</b> of the paper are UG/PG/PhD students currently registered in an Indian academic institution. The goal here is to identify a faculty mentor from among the experts who are at IndoSys to give feedback at the symposium, and also guide the paper to a high quality research outcome subsequently through ongoing interactions.</p>
